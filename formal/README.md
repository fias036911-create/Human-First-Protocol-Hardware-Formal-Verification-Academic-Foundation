# Formal examples

This folder contains minimal formal-model examples (NuSMV format) to demonstrate property checks and reproducible verification runs.

Files

- `example.smv` — a tiny state machine and a trivial CTL property you can check with NuSMV.

Run with NuSMV (if installed):

```sh
nusmv formal/example.smv
```
