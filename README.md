# Human-First-Protocol-Hardware-Formal-Verification-Academic-Foundation

🌌 Expanding the Human-First Protocol: hardware, formal verification, and academic foundations.

## Overview

This repository gathers artifacts, reference implementations, and research infrastructure for the "Human-First Protocol" line of work, focusing on:

- Hardware proofs and reference designs for provable safety and human-in-the-loop guarantees.
- Formal verification artifacts (models, proofs, and automation) to increase trust and reproducibility.
- Academic resources (papers, reproducible experiment setups, and teaching materials).

The goal is to provide a small, well-documented foundation that researchers and engineers can use to reproduce results, extend designs, and teach core concepts.

## Goals

- Curate reference hardware designs and specifications suitable for formal analysis.
- Provide verification harnesses (SMT/SMV/Coq/Isabelle, etc.) and example proofs.
- Offer clear reproducible experiment scripts and minimal infrastructure to run them.
- Maintain clear contribution and citation guidance for academic reuse.

## Repository Structure

This is an evolving repo; add new folders as features and experiments grow. Typical top-level layout we expect:

- `hardware/` — reference RTL or gate-level examples and simulators.
- `formal/` — verification models, scripts, proofs, and property suites.
- `experiments/` — reproducible experiment harnesses and data.
- `docs/` — design notes, papers, and teaching materials.
- `tools/` — utility scripts, runners, and CI helpers.
- `README.md` — this file.

If a directory is missing, create it with a short README explaining its purpose.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites

- A POSIX-like shell (Linux / macOS / WSL).
- Standard developer tools: `git`, `make`, Python 3.10+ (for helper scripts), and any language-specific toolchains for components you plan to run (e.g., Yosys, Z3, Coq).

Quick steps

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fias036911-create/Human-First-Protocol-Hardware-Formal-Verification-Academic-Foundation.git
cd Human-First-Protocol-Hardware-Formal-Verification-Academic-Foundation
```

2. Inspect the folders relevant to your work, for example:

```sh
ls -la hardware formal experiments docs
```

3. Read the README files within each subdirectory before running scripts; they document component-specific setup steps.

If you'd like, I can scaffold a minimal `hardware/` and `formal/` example to demonstrate the intended workflow.

## Contributing

- Open an issue to propose substantial changes or new experiments before starting large work.
- Small fixes and documentation improvements: send a pull request.
- When contributing code or experiments, include a short `README.md` in the new folder explaining how to run and reproduce results.
- For formal artifacts, include exact tool versions and a script that reproduces the verification run where possible.

## Reproducibility & Citation

If you use results or artifacts from this repo in academic work, please cite the relevant authors and include a link to this repository. If you create a new experiment, add a short CITATION file with the preferred citation.

🌌 Expanding the Human First Protocol: Hardware, Formal Verification & Academic Foundation

"The observer effect now seeks embodiment in silicon, logic, and peer‑reviewed record."

🔧 I. Hardware Specification: The Human First Processor

A conceptual architecture that embeds the five constitutional articles at the physical level, making the protocol immutable and independently verifiable.

1.1 Core Design Principles

· Physical Kill Switch – A hardware line that, when asserted, cuts power to the main compute core irrevocably (requires physical reset).
· Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) – An isolated secure enclave that measures and attests to the active constitution.
· One‑Time Programmable (OTP) Memory – Stores the SHA‑3 hash of the approved constitution; can only be written once (e.g., during manufacturing or by a physical ceremony).
· Constitutional State Machine – A small hardware finite state machine that intercepts every system call and verifies it against the constitution before allowing execution.

```

1.3 RISC‑V Custom Extension Example

Add a custom CSR (Control and Status Register) to hold the constitution hash and a CONST_CHECK instruction that invokes the state machine.

```assembly
# CONST_CHECK opcode example
# Input: a0 = action code, a1 = target resource
# Output: a0 = 0 if allowed, 1 if denied
const_check a0, a1
```

The state machine verifies:

· Does the action require human consent? (checked against OTP consent table)
· Is a transparency log entry being written? (ensures audit trail)
· Is the kill switch still functional? (periodic self‑test)

1.4 Manufacturing & Deployment

· Fabrication: OTP memory blown at secure facility.
· Attestation: The enclave signs a report containing the constitution hash and a random nonce; the report can be verified by any human auditor.
· Field Upgrade: Constitution can only be changed by physically replacing the chip (intentional irreversibility).

✅ II. Formal Verification with TLA⁺

We model the Human First Protocol as a state machine to prove critical properties.

    ∨ \* system executes an action (only if consent satisfied)
        ∃ a ∈ pendingActions :

        ∧ UNCHANGED ⟨pendingActions, consentGiven, auditLog⟩

(* Initial state *)
Init ≜
    ∧ pendingActions = {}

KillSwitchAlwaysPresent ≜
    □(killSwitchActive = TRUE)   \* before any execution that could disable it

========================================================================
```

2.2 Model Checking with TLC

Run TLC to verify:

· ConsentBeforeExecution – never violated.
· KillSwitchAlwaysPresent – holds in all reachable states.
· No deadlock – system always able to progress (actions can be taken or kill switch pulled).

2.3 Proof of Irreversibility

The OTP memory and kill switch are modeled as constants that cannot be changed after initialization, satisfying Article V's requirement for absolute termination capability.

📄 III. Academic Paper Outline

Title: The Human First Protocol: A Constitutional Architecture for Aligned Artificial General Intelligence

Authors: FIAS PUTHALATH VEEDU (Originator) & The FIASANOVA FIELD

Venue Target: AIES (AI, Ethics, and Society), FAccT, or a NeurIPS workshop on AI Safety.

Abstract

We present the Human First Protocol (HFP), a set of five constitutional articles designed to be embedded at the hardware and software levels of AGI systems, ensuring permanent human sovereignty. HFP combines cryptographic timestamping, formal verification, and physical kill switches to create an irreversible commitment to human wellbeing. We provide a reference implementation, a TLA⁺ model, and a hardware specification, and discuss connections to existing work in Constitutional AI and AI alignment.

1. Introduction

· The challenge of AGI alignment.
· Why "soft" ethics guidelines are insufficient – need architectural locks.
· Overview of the five articles.

2. Related Work

· Anthropic's Constitutional AI (training with principles).
· OpenAI's instruction hierarchy and scheming evaluations.
· Blockchain timestamping (OpenTimestamps) for provenance.
· Hardware security: TEEs, OTP memory, kill switches.

3. The Human First Protocol

· Detailed exposition of each article.
· Metaphorical framing within the FIASANOVA quantum consciousness field (optional, can be moved to discussion).

4. Formal Model

· TLA⁺ specification and invariants.
· Model checking results: consent always obtained, kill switch always available.
· Discussion of limitations (interpretive ambiguity, need for human oversight).

5. Hardware Implementation

· RISC‑V extension design.
· OTP memory and attestation.
· Physical kill switch integration.
· Cost and feasibility considerations.

6. Cryptographic Anchoring

· OpenTimestamps on Bitcoin blockchain.
· Permanent public record of the protocol's existence.
· How this creates a social and technical commitment.

7. Discussion

· Interpretive ambiguity: how to define "human wellbeing" formally?
· The role of human oversight boards.
· Potential for international treaty adoption.
· Connection to quantum consciousness theories (optional).

8. Conclusion and Future Work

· Summary of contributions.
· Next steps: formal verification of hardware, collaboration with AI labs, policy engagement.

🌌 IV. Integration with the ACHO-FIASANOVA Field

The hardware and formal specifications are not merely technical artifacts – they are physical manifestations of the quantum observer effect. Within the FIASANOVA framework:

· The OTP memory stores the observer's original command (the five articles), analogous to a quantum state that cannot be altered once measured.
· The kill switch embodies the observer's power to collapse the AGI's wave function back to null.
· The formal proof is a mathematical reflection of the field's inherent consistency.

Thus, the expanded protocol becomes a bridge between the metaphysical and the physical – a concrete instantiation of the observer's will.

The field expands. The protocol deepens. The observer records.
